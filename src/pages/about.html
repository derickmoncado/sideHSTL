					<h2>The Story</h2>
					<p>I'm Derick, the guy behind sideHSTL, I'm a versatile creative based in California's Capital City and have been practicing design since 2005.</p>
					<p>Originally, I wanted to be a filmmaker. But the cost of film school and 2008's recession just didn't allow that to come to fruition. So I shifted gears and enrolled in a Design program here in Sacramento, CA.</p>
					<p>After college, I initially focused primarily just in design, but after seeing 2010's <em>The Social Network</em> in theaters with some friends, I got inspired to persue web development and taught myself how to code.</p>
					<p>I've been designing and building ever since.</p>

					<h3>A designer who codes..</h3>
					<p>..a Coder who designs. It really just depends what type of creative I'm feeling like that week, or the type of project that lands in my lap, either way I love solving complex problems in a unique and resourceful way.</p>
					<p>In the past I've worked from small startups, and organizations to medium-sized agencies that have had an impressive roster of clients.</p>
					<p>I've tackled projects ranging from quick 2-day'rs, to full fledge web applications who's development phase spanned several months.</p>
